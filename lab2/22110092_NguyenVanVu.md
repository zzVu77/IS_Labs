# Task 1: Firewall configuration 
**Question 1**: 
Setup a set of vms/containers in a network configuration of 2 subnets (1,2) with a router forwarding traffic between them. Relevant services are also required:
- The router is initially can not route traffic between subnets
- PC0 on subnet 1 serves as a web server on subnet 1
- PC1,PC2 on subnet 2 acts as client workstations on subnet 2 
**Answer 1**:


**Question 2**:
- Enable packet forwarding on the router.
- Deface the webserver's home page with ssh connection on PC1
**Answer 2**:

**Question 3**:
  Config the router to block ssh to web server from PC1, leaving ssh/web access normally for all other hosts from subnet 1.   

**Answer 3**:

**Question 4**:
- PC1 now servers as a UDP server, make sure that it can reply UDP ping from other hosts on both subnets.
- Config personal firewall on PC1 to block UDP accesses from PC2 while leaving UDP access from the server intact.
**Answer 4**:


# Task 2: Encrypting large message 
Use PC0 and PC2 for this lab 
Create a text file at least 56 bytes on PC2 this file will be sent encrypted to PC0
**Question 1**:
Encrypt the file with aes-cipher in CTR and OFB modes. How do you evaluate both cipher in terms of error propagation and adjacent plaintext blocks are concerned. 
**Answer 1**:
- Demonstrate your ability to send file to PC0 to with message authentication measure.
- Verify the received file for each cipher modes
**Question 2**:
- Assume the 6th bit in the ciphered file is corrupted.
- Verify the received files for each cipher mode on PC0

**Answer 2**:

**Question 3**:
- Decrypt corrupted files on PC0.
- Comment on both ciphers in terms of error propagation and adjacent plaintext blocks criteria.
